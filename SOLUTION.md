## SOLUTION.md

### Overview

The solution improves both backend and frontend performance, correctness, and user experience. The main focus areas were non-blocking operations, data validation, caching, and safe component lifecycle handling.

### Backend Changes

1. **Non-Blocking I/O & Async Calls**

   * Converted blocking calls to async, non-blocking I/O to improve scalability and responsiveness.
   * **Benefit:** Increased throughput, better performance under load.
   * **Trade-off:** Slightly more complex error handling due to async flow.

2. **Validation on New Item Creation**

   * Added stricter validation logic before saving new items.
   * **Benefit:** Prevents invalid or duplicate data from entering the system.
   * **Trade-off:** Slight increase in request processing time due to validation.

3. **Caching in Statistics Endpoint**

   * Implemented a cache mechanism to store computed stats temporarily.
   * **Benefit:** Reduced repeated heavy computations, improved response times.
   * **Trade-off:** Slightly stale data is possible until cache expiry.

### Frontend Changes

1. **AbortController for Mounted/Unmounted Calls**

   * Integrated AbortController in data-fetching hooks to cancel pending requests when a component unmounts.
   * **Benefit:** Prevents memory leaks and avoids state updates on unmounted components.
   * **Trade-off:** Additional logic to manage abort signals.

2. **Lifecycle Safety**

   * Ensured all network calls are tied to the component lifecycle, improving app stability.

### Summary

The changes strike a balance between **performance** (non-blocking I/O, caching), **data integrity** (validation), and **user experience** (safe lifecycle handling). The trade-off is slightly increased code complexity, but the gains in speed, reliability, and scalability outweigh this.
